We stand at a threshold. Traditional mathematics has served humanity for millennia, enabling technology, science, and understanding. Yet it describes only half of mathematical reality—the collapsed half.
Zero-Base Persistent Mathematics offers the other half. Not as replacement, but as completion. Not as revolution, but as evolution.
The evidence spans domains:

Physics: Dark matter is persistent mass
Quantum: Wave functions are persistent states
AI: Catastrophic forgetting solved
Cryptography: Quantum resistance achieved
Finance: Hidden value revealed
Consciousness: The hard problem clarified

The mathematics is consistent. The applications are practical. The philosophy is profound.
What remains is validation—experimental, theoretical, communal. That work begins now.
We invite mathematicians to prove or disprove the theorems. We invite physicists to test the predictions. We invite computer scientists to optimize the implementations. We invite educators to teach the framework. We invite philosophers to explore the implications.
Most of all, we invite curiosity. The question that sparked this framework was simple: "Why doesn't 1 × 1 = 2?"
The answer opened a door. Beyond that door lies a mathematics that honors both sides, conserves displacement, and makes zero the foundation.
A mathematics that might finally be complete.
